## Mini APK Tools

This is a set of very simple bash scripts to check signatures and other metadata of Android APKs.
This is not something I consider worth publishing, these are quick-and-dirty scripts that I made for myself.

But someone just contacted me about the possibility of writing software that does exactly what these scripts do,
so I am publishing them to help this person.

Some highlights:

- **apk-info:** display metadata of APKs.
- **apk-rename:** rename APKs based on their metadata.
- **jar-check:** verify JARs/APKs and their signatures.
- **jar-check-diff:** check JARs/APKs and compare their signatures.
